# C009 (version 2): Nat-source representation via minimal S-closed substructure

Claim ledger C009 (status: CONJECTURE, novelty: NOVELTY_UNASSESSED).
Branch: basepoint_relativity.

★ Discipline: the generated object must be defined WITHOUT `Function.iterate`,
`orbit : ℕ → H`, or `Relation.TransGen` (they encode finitely-many steps, n ∈ ℕ,
which is exactly what we are trying to explain). Instead we use set-theoretic
intersection (minimal closure):

  Closed(C)   :⟺ e ∈ C ∧ ∀ x ∈ C, σ x ∈ C
  Chain(e)    := ⋂ {C : Set H | Closed C}     (minimal σ-closed substructure)

This file defines Closed / Chain via set intersection (no iteration), and proves:
  * `Chain(e)` contains `e`
  * `Chain(e)` is σ-closed (σ x ∈ Chain(e) whenever x ∈ Chain(e))
  * minimality: Chain(e) ⊆ C for every σ-closed C containing e

The representation theorem ((Chain(e), σ) ≅ (N, S) when σ is injective on
Chain(e) and e ∉ σ(Chain(e))) is the classical Dedekind simple-infinite-system
characterization (KNOWN baseline).

★ Note (ordinal-like): pure unary successor closure does NOT produce limit
stages. Even with H = Ord, σ(α) = α+1, e = 0, the minimal closure Chain(0) is
still {0, 1, 2, ...} and does not contain ω: minimality only demands successor
closure, not that limits of chains inside are included. Ordinal-like structures
require an ENRICHED generation law with a limit rule (e.g. `L(C)` or a supremum
closure `C directed ⟹ sup C ∈ C`).

The research question after the representation theorem is how the generated
structure changes when the basepoint e and the generation law σ_e both vary:
compare (Chain_e, e, σ_e) with (Chain_f, f, σ_f) for a basepoint-dependent
generation law Γ : e ↦ σ_e.

/-! ## Representation theorem: (Chain(σ,e), σ) ≅ (ℕ, S) — Dedekind simple infinite system

The representation theorem (C009): if σ is injective on Chain(e) and
e ∉ σ(Chain(e)) (the successor never cycles back to the basepoint), then
Chain(e) with the successor σ is isomorphic to ℕ with the successor
function (Dedekind simple infinite system, KNOWN).

The construction (a REPRESENTATION RESULT — ℕ appears in the conclusion,
not in the definition of the generated object, per the Nat-independence
discipline):

  f : ℕ → Chain(e),  f(0) = e,  f(n+1) = σ(f(n))

* f well-defined: f(n) ∈ Chain(e) by induction (chain_mem_self +
  chain_closed).
* f injective: σ injective on Chain(e) + e ∉ σ(Chain(e)) (no cycle
  through the basepoint).
* f surjective: minimality — the image of f is σ-closed and contains e,
  so Chain(e) ⊆ im f (chain_minimal).
