# C006: basepoint-relative step translation and its teleport in a heap

Claim ledger C006 (status: PROVED, novelty: DIRECT_COROLLARY / KNOWN).
Branch: basepoint_relativity.

The basepoint-relative step TRANSLATION: `τ_{e,a}(x) = [x, e, a]` (in the retract
group `G_e` this is `x ↦ x +_e a` — a translation, NOT a Peano successor), and
basepoint change `T_{e→f}(x) = [x, e, f]`.

Main theorem (teleport, holds in ANY heap, not only abelian):
  `T_{e→f} (τ_{e,a} x) = τ_{f, T_{e→f}(a)} (T_{e→f} x)`.
That is, the endpoint `a` must be teleported to `T_{e→f}(a) = [a,e,f]`.
Proof uses only para-associativity and the identity laws; no commutation.

Interpretation: `a` is "the endpoint representing a step when `e` is the origin";
`T_{e→f}(a)` is "the endpoint representing the SAME step when `f` is the origin".
The invariant is the relative displacement `(e, a)`, not `a` itself.

This is a direct corollary of the standard fact that a heap translation is a heap
morphism: `T_{e→f}` is a heap automorphism with `T_{e→f}(e) = f`, so
`T_{e→f}([x,e,a]) = [T_{e→f}(x), f, T_{e→f}(a)]`.

Counterexample (same endpoint, no teleport): in ℤ-heap `[x,y,z]=x-y+z`,
`e=0,f=1,a=2,x=0` gives `[[0,0,2],0,1]=3 ≠ [[0,0,1],1,2]=2`. A NON-abelian heap
(any non-commutative group `[x,y,z]=x y⁻¹ z`) also distinguishes `[a,e,f]` from
`[f,e,a]` — so this is why the plain `Heap` hypothesis is the right level.
