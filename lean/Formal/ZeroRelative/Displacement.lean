# C007: Displacement equivalence and the basepoint-free change space

Claim ledger C007 (status: PROVED on the group model ℤ, novelty: KNOWN).
Branch: basepoint_relativity.

On a heap `H` (here the group model `ℤ` with `[x,y,z] = x - y + z`), define
displacement equivalence:
  `(e,a) ∼ (f,b) :⟺ b = [a,e,f] = a - e + f`.
That is, `(f, b)` represents the SAME relative displacement as `(e,a)` after
basepoint change `e ↦ f`.

Facts (verified here on the ℤ model):
* ∼ is an equivalence relation (reflexive / symmetric / transitive).
* For each fixed basepoint `e`, the map `a ↦ a - e` (the "relative displacement"
  coordinate) is a bijection `H → H`, so the change space recovers the group
  `G_e` — the quotient classes are in bijection with the acting group.

Interpretation: a single "numerical point" `a` is NOT basepoint-invariant; the
invariant is the relative displacement `(e,a)` (equivalently the translation
`τ_{e,a} : x ↦ x +_e a`). Choosing a basepoint trivializes the change space back
into the group. This matches the classical torsor / translation-group picture,
so novelty is KNOWN (a baseline for later: defining iteration on this
basepoint-free change space).
