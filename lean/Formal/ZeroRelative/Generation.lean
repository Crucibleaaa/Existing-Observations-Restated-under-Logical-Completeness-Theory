# C008: Endogenous basepoint generation — reachability structure, no Nat index

Claim ledger C008 (status: CONJECTURE → OBSERVATION, novelty: NOVELTY_UNASSESSED).
Branch: basepoint_relativity.

★ Foundational fix (user directive): do NOT presuppose the natural numbers.
The research question is "how does the natural-number-like iteration structure
EMERGE from basepoint changes" — so Nat must not be a primitive of the iteration
apparatus. `Function.iterate F n`, `F^[n]`, `orbit : ℕ → H`, and Church numerals
all presuppose Nat and are BANNED from this branch.

Here we study an unpointed structure `H` with a generation relation
`R : H → H → Prop` (e' is a sub-basepoint generated from e). Reachability is
`Relation.TransGen R` (transitive closure) — the object-level statements carry NO
natural-number coordinate for positions.

Observations recorded here (from finite enumeration, C008_reachability*.py):
* A total function σ : H → H on a FINITE set always has a cycle — so ω-like
  chains require either a PARTIAL rule (a "dead end" / terminal) or an infinite H.
* Partial generation rules realize: chains (ω truncations), branching trees,
  cycles/rho, isolated points. These are the structure types that can occur.

/-- C008: reachability structure types are exactly the functional-graph types
(chain truncations / cycles / rho / branching / isolated). This is recorded as an
OBSERVATION from finite enumeration; Lean formalizes the relation machinery
(single/trans), and the classification is documented in the enumeration scripts. -/
